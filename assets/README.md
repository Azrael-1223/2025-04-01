This symbol represents the eternal cycle of growth, destruction, and rebirth, reflecting my journey in cybersecurity and personal development. The **Infinity Dragon** embodies the paradox of wisdom gained through time and the relentless pursuit of progress. It is a mark of constant evolution—just like the infinite loop of learning and self-improvement.

The dragon eating its own tail symbolizes the idea of perpetual motion and reinvention. It’s not just a logo—it’s a reminder that nothing truly ends, but always gives birth to something new.
